# Blockchain Applications of EAAD

## Features
- **Harmonic Validation**: Transactions are validated through Krystal Spiral linkages.
- **Scalable Layers**: Nested structures support high transaction throughput.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Reduced computational overhead compared to traditional blockchains.

## Implementation Roadmap
1. Deploy a testnet with Krystal Spiral node placement.
2. Implement Proof of Harmony consensus for efficient validation.
3. Scale layers for multi-dimensional data processing.
